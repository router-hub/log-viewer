# Building macOS Packages from Windows

Since you're on Windows, here are the options to build macOS packages:

## Option 1: GitHub Actions (Easiest)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add build workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create a release tag**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Check GitHub Actions**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click on "Actions" tab
   - The workflow will automatically build for all platforms
   - Download the macOS build from the artifacts

## Option 2: Use a Mac (if available)

If you have access to a Mac:

1. **Clone your repository on the Mac**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd log-viewer-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build for macOS**
   ```bash
   npm run dist:mac
   ```

4. **The macOS app will be in `dist-electron/mac/`**

## Option 3: Use a Mac in the Cloud

### Using GitHub Codespaces:

1. **Create a codespace**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click the green "Code" button
   - Select "Codespaces" tab
   - Click "Create codespace on main"

2. **In the codespace terminal:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dist:mac
   ```

3. **Download the built files**
   - Right-click on `dist-electron/mac/` in the file explorer
   - Select "Download..."

### Using MacStadium or similar:

1. **Rent a Mac in the cloud** (MacStadium, MacinCloud, etc.)
2. **Follow the same steps as Option 2**

## Option 4: Use Electron Forge (Alternative)

If electron-builder continues to have issues, you can switch to Electron Forge:

1. **Install Electron Forge**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @electron-forge/cli
   npx electron-forge import
   ```

2. **Build for macOS**
   ```bash
   npm run make
   ```

## Current Status

Your Windows build is working! The macOS build requires:
- A macOS environment (real Mac, cloud Mac, or CI/CD)
- Proper code signing certificates (for distribution)
- Apple Developer account (for App Store distribution)

## Quick Test

To test if your app works on macOS without building:

1. **Install the app on a Mac**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **If it works in development, the build should work too**

## Next Steps

1. **For immediate sharing**: Use the Windows build you already have
2. **For cross-platform**: Use GitHub Actions (Option 1)
3. **For production**: Get access to a Mac or use cloud services

The Windows executable you have (`dist-electron/win-unpacked/Log Viewer.exe`) can be shared with Windows users immediately!
